# Summary

I set my daughter up with a new art workstation, but she's got limited space and I didn't want her desk to be cluttered up with all of her art supplies.  A pegboard seemed like a great solution, but all of the regular pegboard stuff I find is intended to hold more traditional workshop tools, and not really designed for holding art supplies like brushes, colored pencils, and paints. 

This is a variety of different types of boxes and bins, and a wide shelf, intended to hold the sort of thing she needed held.  If they were useful to me, I figured they could be useful to someone else too.

All of the notches in the vectors are designed with 1/8th inch thick plywood in mind (so .125in which is fairly equivalent to 3mm thick plywood if your source is metric)

The vectors are organized so you can understand and identify the parts for all of the different box types.  They are *not* laid out in an optimized arrangement for materials use.  Whatever size your material is, you'll want to rearrange the pieces so that they fit your space with the least wasted space.


If you want some of these guys, but don't have a lasercutter of your own, I'm totally game for cutting the parts and shipping them, or going all the way to assembling and shipping things.  I can even customize the sizes and shapes of things for you.  You can message me on etsy through my shop here -
